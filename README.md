# Katas
These are worked problems to hone my craft.
Most of these problems will come from projecteuler.net/archives, and will be labeled as such. I will be practicing, functional programming, test driven development, and refactoring with these katas. Please let me know if you think something should be done differently. This is an exercise for me to learn and improve so criticism is welcome!
